				<p>
					This little project illustrates a few steps of data analysis on the famous Iris dataset.
					The <b>Iris flower data set</b> (also called Fisher's Iris data set, named after the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher)
					is one of the most famous starter dataset for Machine Learning and Data Analysis use cases.

					It is widely used as a beginner project as it is not a very complex dataset, containing only 150 observations of 4 features.<br/>
					These observations of Iris flowers are splitted into 3 classes, corresponding to 3 species of Iris flowers : 
					<b>Setosa,</b> <b>Versicolor</b> and <b>Virginica</b>.<br/><br/>
					
					A first simple analysis we can perform on this dataset is to have a look at the number of samples collected for every species of
					Iris flowers. This can be done in numerous ways, the chosen one here is to represent the proportion of samples within every class
					with a donut, each part representing a dedicated species (Setosa, Versicolor or Virginica).
				</p>

                <div id="container-donutchart">

                <p>
					As we can see here, and as it was expected regarding the composition and construction of the dataset, <b>every species contains exactly
					the same number of observations</b>, 50 elements to be precise. This is what we call a perfectly balancer dataset, and this is very good
					information as a starter, because in many cases of real life datasets, this is not the case, and this can lead to various problems,
					such as generalisation difficulties.<br/><br/>

					Another interesting analysis that can be performed is univariate analysis, along available factors/features (4 in our case, namely
					flowers sepals length/width and petals length/width). These features, also called characteristics or attributes of the dataset, are
					numeric, especially with floating point numbers. This is an interesting point, as it permits us to analyze these features with boxplots,
					a familiar and concise representation.<br/><br/>

					Boxplots contain multiple interesting information and values such as the mean, the median, quartiles, min and max values of the sample.
					Each of these information can be quickly read from the diagram, and helps performing quick comparisons for subgroups in the data sample.
					We can see in the following plot a set of these box plots for every species of Iris flowers, and every numeric feature forming the
					characteristics of the sample.
				</p>

				<div id="container-boxplot">
					<canvas id="iris_features_boxplot"></canvas>
				</div>

                <p>
					The boxplot shows a clear difference between Setosa species and the other two species. <b>Setosa flowers clearly have shorter and thinner
					petals</b> than Versicolor and Virginica species, making them easily distinguishable. Another evidence that can arise from these boxplots
					is that <b>Virginica species tend to have higher values than Versicolor flowers</b> in every feature, also permitting an easier distinction
					between these two species.<br/><br/>

					An other interesting representation of these information is available in the form of a scatterplot. Scatterplots are usually used to represent
					the relationship between two numeric features, drawing each dimension on a separate axis. This usually helps to quickly deduce whether a
					linear or a polynomial relationship or correlation occurs between these two variables.<br/><br/>

					The following scatterplot exactly shows the same information and remarks about Setosa being a highly distinguishable species compared to
					the other two, as well as Virginica flowers having globally higher features values than Versicolor species. The scatterplot also showcases
					<b>the relationship between the flowers petals length and petals width</b>, that seems to be linear (a line could be drawn, passing through
					these sets of points).
				</p>

                <div id="container-scatterplot">
					<canvas id="iris_petals_scatterplot"></canvas>
				</div>
                
                <p>
					We could also interpret and deduce many things from this scatterplot, such as classification rules of thumbs. For example, we could divide the
					range of values for those two features (petals length and petals width), each one into 3 different zones, forming a 3x3 grid. We could definitely
					deduce high level classification rules for Iris species, based on those two characteristics and the number of observations within every cell.<br/><br/>

					Finally, another global analysis could be performed on these Iris flowers species thanks to a radar. Radar is a powerful comparison tool, usually
					used to compare profiles and spans of every kind. But it is also a more generic tool when it comes to quickly compare groups of data observations.<br/><br/>

					In the following graph, the means of every feature (petals/sepals length/width) for the three different species have been computed and plotted
					on a radar. This really helps to compare Iris species in the blink of an eye, based on their mean features values. Of course, mean values should be
					interpreted with caution, especially when the number of sampled data is low, but it still gives valuable information.
				</p>

                <div id="container-radarchart">
					<canvas id="iris_features_radar"></canvas>
				</div>

                <p>
					From this radar chart, we can retrieve the same conclusions and remarks we built with the other graphs. We clearly see a <b>smaller profile based on
					the features mean values for the Iris Setosa species</b> compared to the other two species. We also confirm our deduction on the <b>average higher values
					on every features for Virginica species compared to Versicolor</b>.<br/><br/>

					The goal of this statistical analysis was to show how quick analysis, deductions and features analysis/comparisons can be performed with the help of
					descriptive and visual tools such as boxplots or radar charts. This little project could be improved and enriched later on, based on the curiosity around
					this Iris flowers data set and the statistical potential it can offer.<br/><br/>
